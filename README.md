<h2>What it does:</h2>
PassGen creates strong passwords with varying length and content. <br />
You can copy these passwords *and* save them to a `.txt` file.
<br />
With version 2.2, PassGen now generates fake names, emails, addresses, usernames, and phone numbers.

<h2>How it works:</h2>
When you click "Generate," the program chooses random characters from a variety of lists that you can choose from,
such as lowercase/uppercase letters, symbols, and numbers.

You can also move the slider to modify the length of the password (6-30 characters). 

Copying the generated password is super simple; just click on it :D <br />
To save, first give it a title, then either select a `.txt` file or use the "New File" function to create a new one!
